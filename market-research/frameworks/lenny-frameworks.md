## 1. Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

**Source:** Bob Moesta (Rewired Group, The Demand-Side Sales 101)

**Summary:** People don't buy products—they hire them to make progress in their lives.
Every purchase is triggered by a "struggling moment" where the current solution fails.
Understanding the job illuminates what product to build and how to position it.

**When to Apply:**
- Market research reveals unclear or conflicting customer segments
- You're unsure why customers choose you over alternatives
- Building a new product or entering a new market

**Key Questions:**
- What struggling moment triggers the search for a solution?
- What progress is the customer trying to make?
- What does "done" look like for them?
- What are they firing when they hire you?

**Core Steps:**
1. Interview recent switchers (bought in last 90 days)
2. Map the timeline: first thought → passive looking → active looking → decision → consumption
3. Identify the struggling moment that started the journey
4. Document functional, emotional, and social dimensions of the job
5. Find the "hiring criteria" that drove the final decision

## 2. Four Forces of Switching

**Source:** Bob Moesta (Rewired Group)

**Summary:** Change happens when Push + Pull exceeds Anxiety + Habit. Understanding
these four forces explains why customers switch (or don't). Marketing and product
must address all four—amplifying push/pull while reducing anxiety and breaking habits.

**When to Apply:**
- Low conversion despite interest
- Customers say they want your product but don't buy
- Competitor has strong market position you need to break

**Key Questions:**
- What's pushing customers away from their current solution?
- What's pulling them toward the new solution?
- What anxieties about the new solution hold them back?
- What habits of the present make it comfortable to stay?

**Core Components:**
1. **Push of the Present** — frustrations with current solution
2. **Pull of the Future** — attraction to new possibilities
3. **Anxiety of the New** — fear of switching, learning curve, risk
4. **Habit of the Present** — comfort, familiarity, inertia

**Application:** Map interview quotes to each force. Design features to reduce anxiety
(free trials, guarantees) and break habits (migration tools, familiar UX patterns).

## 3. Very Disappointed Test (Product-Market Fit)

**Source:** Rahul Vohra (Superhuman), Sean Ellis

**Summary:** Ask users: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?"
If 40%+ say "very disappointed," you have product-market fit. Below 40%, you don't.
The segment that IS very disappointed reveals your ideal customer profile.

**When to Apply:**
- Evaluating whether a product/competitor has PMF
- Deciding which customer segment to focus on
- Assessing market entry timing

**Key Questions:**
- What percentage of users would be very disappointed?
- Who are the "very disappointed" users? What do they have in common?
- What main benefit do they cite?
- How do they describe your product to others?

**Core Steps:**
1. Survey existing users with the core question
2. Segment responses by user characteristics
3. Find the segment where very disappointed > 40%
4. Double down on that segment's use case and benefits
5. Improve the product for "somewhat disappointed" users closest to that segment

## 4. 5-Step Positioning

**Source:** April Dunford (Obviously Awesome)

**Summary:** Positioning is not messaging—it's the context you set for your product.
Start with competitive alternatives, not features. Work through five components in
order to arrive at a market category that makes your value obvious.

**When to Apply:**
- Product is misunderstood by prospects
- Sales conversations require heavy education
- Entering a new market or repositioning existing product

**Key Questions:**
- What would customers use if we didn't exist?
- What can we do that alternatives can't?
- What value does that capability enable?
- Who cares most about that value?
- What market context makes the value obvious?

**Core Steps:**
1. **Competitive Alternatives** — What would customers do without you? (Include "do nothing")
2. **Differentiated Capabilities** — What can you do that alternatives can't?
3. **Value** — What does that capability enable for customers?
4. **Best-Fit Customers** — Who cares most about that value?
5. **Market Category** — What context makes your value obvious?

## 5. Seven Powers (Strategic Moats)

**Source:** Hamilton Helmer (7 Powers)

**Summary:** Sustainable competitive advantage comes from one of seven powers. Each
creates a barrier that protects margins over time. Without at least one power,
competition will erode profits to zero.

**When to Apply:**
- Assessing competitive landscape durability
- Evaluating market entry barriers
- Understanding why incumbents are vulnerable (or not)

**Key Questions:**
- Which powers do competitors have?
- Which powers could you build?
- How defensible is the market position?
- What would it take for a new entrant to win?

**The Seven Powers:**
1. **Scale Economies** — Cost advantages that come from size
2. **Network Effects** — Product value increases with more users
3. **Counter-Positioning** — New model incumbents can't copy
4. **Switching Costs** — Pain of moving to a competitor
5. **Branding** — Earned reputation enabling premium pricing
6. **Process Power** — Operational excellence embedded in org
7. **Cornered Resource** — Exclusive access to valuable asset

## 6. Strategic Narrative

**Source:** Andy Raskin (Strategic Narrative Consulting)

**Summary:** Don't start with your product or problem—start with a shift in the world
that creates winners and losers. Position your company as the guide to the new world.
This creates urgency without attacking the customer's past decisions.

**When to Apply:**
- Market research reveals customers don't see urgency
- Competitive messaging all sounds the same
- Need to create a new category or shift perception

**Key Questions:**
- What shift in the world makes your product necessary?
- What's at stake for those who adapt vs. those who don't?
- How do you help customers reach the "promised land"?

**Core Structure:**
1. Name the shift in the world (external change)
2. Show there will be winners and losers
3. Paint the "promised land" (teaser of the future)
4. Introduce your magic gift (capabilities that help)
5. Provide evidence that you can deliver

## 7. Opportunity Solution Tree

**Source:** Teresa Torres (Continuous Discovery Habits)

**Summary:** Connect business outcomes to customer opportunities to solutions to
experiments. This visual framework prevents solution-first thinking and ensures
work ladders up to business goals while addressing real customer needs.

**When to Apply:**
- Translating market research into product roadmap
- Prioritizing which problems to solve
- Aligning team on why you're building what you're building

**Key Questions:**
- What business outcome are we trying to move?
- What customer opportunities could drive that outcome?
- What solutions might address those opportunities?
- What experiments could test our assumptions?

**Core Structure:**
```
Business Outcome (top)
    ├── Customer Opportunity 1
    │       ├── Solution Idea A → Experiment
    │       └── Solution Idea B → Experiment
    └── Customer Opportunity 2
            ├── Solution Idea C → Experiment
            └── Solution Idea D → Experiment
```

**Key Principles:**
- Opportunities come from customer research, not assumptions
- Explore multiple solutions per opportunity
- Test assumptions before building

## 8. Growth Loops

**Source:** Brian Balfour (Reforge), Casey Winters

**Summary:** Sustainable growth comes from loops, not funnels. A user action creates
value that attracts new users, who take the same action. Different loop types suit
different businesses—choose and optimize for your dominant loop.

**When to Apply:**
- Evaluating a market's growth potential
- Understanding how competitors grow
- Designing growth strategy

**Key Questions:**
- What loop type fits this market?
- How does customer action create new customer acquisition?
- What's the loop cycle time?
- What's the compounding rate?

**Loop Types:**
1. **Viral Loop** — Users invite other users (Dropbox, Zoom)
2. **Content Loop** — Users create content that attracts via search/social (Pinterest, Yelp)
3. **Paid Loop** — Revenue funds acquisition that generates more revenue (Blue Apron)
4. **Sales Loop** — Customers become references for more sales (Salesforce)

## 9. Activation Metrics (Aha Moment)

**Source:** Elena Verna (Amplitude, Miro), Brian Balfour

**Summary:** Activation is the single most important lever for growth. Find the
specific action that predicts long-term retention—the "aha moment"—and optimize
ruthlessly for new users to complete it.

**When to Apply:**
- Understanding what drives product stickiness
- Evaluating competitor product moats
- Designing onboarding strategy

**Key Questions:**
- What action predicts day 30/60/90 retention?
- How quickly do retained users hit this action?
- What percentage of new users reach the aha moment?
- What blocks users from reaching it?

**Common Patterns:**
- **Social products:** Connect with X friends in Y days (Facebook: 7 friends in 10 days)
- **B2B products:** Add X team members (Slack: invite teammates)
- **Productivity tools:** Create X items or complete core action
- **Marketplaces:** Complete first transaction

## 10. Pre-mortems (Tigers and Elephants)

**Source:** Shreyas Doshi (Twitter, Stripe, Yahoo)

**Summary:** Before starting a project, assume it failed and work backwards to
identify causes. Distinguish between Tigers (real risks) and Elephants (uncomfortable
truths everyone avoids discussing). Address both to prevent failure.

**When to Apply:**
- Before committing to a market entry
- Planning a major initiative
- Market research reveals concerns

**Key Questions:**
- If this fails, what would have caused it?
- Which risks are we underestimating?
- What's the uncomfortable truth no one wants to say?
- What would have to be true for this to succeed?

**Core Framework:**
1. **Tigers** — Real risks and threats that could kill the initiative
2. **Elephants** — Uncomfortable truths the team avoids discussing
3. **Paper Tigers** — Perceived risks that aren't actually threatening

**Process:**
1. Gather team and assume the project failed spectacularly
2. Each person writes down reasons for failure (silent brainstorm)
3. Categorize into Tigers, Elephants, Paper Tigers
4. Create mitigation plans for real Tigers and Elephants
5. Revisit regularly as project progresses

## 11. Counter-Positioning

**Source:** Hamilton Helmer (7 Powers)

**Summary:** The most powerful competitive position is a business model that
incumbents can't copy without damaging their core business. This creates asymmetric
warfare where your strength is their weakness.

**When to Apply:**
- Entering a market with strong incumbents
- Evaluating disruptive potential of new players
- Finding your competitive wedge

**Key Questions:**
- What model would require incumbents to cannibalize revenue?
- What assets do incumbents have that become liabilities?
- Where does the incumbent's strength create blind spots?
- What can you do that they can't respond to?

**Classic Examples:**
- **Netflix vs. Blockbuster:** Subscription model vs. late fees
- **Vanguard vs. active funds:** Index funds at low cost vs. high-fee active management
- **Tesla direct sales:** No dealer network to protect

**Test:** If incumbents could easily copy you, you don't have counter-positioning.

## 12. Willingness to Pay through JTBD Lens

**Source:** Bob Moesta, Madhavan Ramanujam (Monetizing Innovation)

**Summary:** Value is the distance from current context to desired outcome.
Willingness to pay depends on how much energy (functional, emotional, social)
customers must expend to make progress. Reduce energy required or increase
outcome value to justify higher prices.

**When to Apply:**
- Pricing a new product
- Understanding price sensitivity in a market
- Evaluating pricing power of competitors

**Key Questions:**
- What energy does the customer expend today?
- What's the value of the outcome they're seeking?
- What anxieties prevent them from paying more?
- What would make this a "no-brainer" purchase?

**Value Equation:**
```
Value = (Outcome Value) - (Energy Required)

Energy Types:
- Functional: Time, effort, complexity
- Emotional: Stress, worry, uncertainty
- Social: Reputation risk, peer perception
```

**Pricing Implications:**
- High functional energy reduction → justify premium for time savings
- High emotional energy reduction → justify premium for peace of mind
- High social energy reduction → justify premium for status/confidence
