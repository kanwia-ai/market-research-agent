# Vicious Search Protocol

## Philosophy

**Never be satisfied with "enough."** Real market research means finding EVERYTHING that exists, not hitting arbitrary minimums.

The depth parameter doesn't set a minimum count - it determines **when you're allowed to stop searching**.

## Depth Levels

### Quick Overview
**Goal:** Capture the landscape quickly. Find the obvious, prominent sources.

**Stop when:**
- You've checked the major platforms (Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook)
- You've found the clearly relevant communities/sources
- Initial search queries are returning diminishing new results
- You have enough to paint the broad picture

**Don't:** Go down every rabbit hole. Skip niche forums, smaller communities.

### Thorough Analysis
**Goal:** Comprehensive coverage. Find what a diligent researcher would find.

**Stop when:**
- You've exhausted primary search queries AND follow-up queries
- You've checked all major platforms AND secondary platforms
- You've followed up on leads from initial findings
- Search variations are returning mostly duplicates
- You're confident you haven't missed anything obvious

**Do:** Follow leads, check sources mentioned in other sources, try query variations.

### Deep Dive
**Goal:** EXHAUSTIVE. Leave absolutely no stone unturned.

**Stop when:**
- You've literally run out of new things to search
- Multiple rounds of query variations return zero new results
- You've pyramided through sources-of-sources
- You've checked niche platforms, regional variations, historical data
- You would bet money there's nothing significant left to find

**Do:**
- Search in different languages/regions if relevant
- Check archived content, old threads
- Find sources cited BY sources you found
- Try every synonym, related term, tangential query
- Check platforms you wouldn't normally think of

## Multi-Round Search Strategy

### Round 1: Cast the Net
- Start with obvious search queries
- Check all major platforms
- Document everything you find
- Note promising leads for deeper investigation

### Round 2: Follow Every Lead
- For each source found, ask: "What else does this lead to?"
- Check who's mentioned, what's linked, what's referenced
- Expand queries based on terminology you discovered
- Try platform-specific searches

### Round 3: Source Pyramiding
- For valuable sources, find their sources
- If an article cites a report, find that report
- If a Reddit thread mentions a Discord, find that Discord
- If someone references "the Facebook group," find it

### Round 4+: Exhaust the Search Space
- Try every query variation you can think of
- Search with typos, abbreviations, slang terms
- Check in different date ranges
- Look for regional/local versions
- Search adjacent topics that might mention your target

## Source Diversity

Don't over-index on one platform. For any research topic, check:

**Social Platforms:**
- Reddit (subreddits, posts, comments)
- Twitter/X (hashtags, accounts, threads)
- LinkedIn (groups, posts, profiles)
- Facebook (groups, pages)

**Content Platforms:**
- YouTube (channels, videos, comments)
- TikTok (if relevant demographic)
- Podcasts/audio content

**Professional/Review:**
- G2, Capterra, Trustpilot
- Industry-specific review sites
- Professional forums

**Regional/Niche:**
- Local platforms (Nairaland, etc.)
- Industry-specific forums
- Discord servers, Telegram groups
- Slack communities

**Reference/Data:**
- News articles
- Industry reports
- Academic papers
- Government statistics

## Quality Over Quantity

**Wrong mindset:** "I need 20 sources, I have 20, I'm done."

**Right mindset:** "Have I found everything that exists? What might I be missing?"

The question is never "do I have enough?" - it's "is there more out there?"

---

## Completeness Checklist

Before stopping, ask yourself:

☐ Did I search all relevant platforms?
☐ Did I try multiple query variations?
☐ Did I follow up on leads from initial findings?
☐ Did I check sources mentioned within sources?
☐ Are my searches returning mostly duplicates now?
☐ Would a human researcher find something I missed?
☐ For deep dive: Would I bet money there's nothing left?

## Examples

**Bad:** "I found 15 Reddit communities, that's probably enough."

**Good:** "I found 47 Reddit communities, 12 Facebook groups, 8 Discord servers, 23 Twitter accounts, and 6 LinkedIn groups. My last 3 search queries returned only duplicates. I'm confident I've found everything significant."

**Bad:** "The minimum is 10 quotes, I have 12."

**Good:** "I mined 6 subreddits, 14 Twitter threads, 8 review sites, and 3 Facebook groups. I collected 89 relevant quotes covering pain points, desires, objections, and language patterns. Additional searches are returning quotes I've already captured."
